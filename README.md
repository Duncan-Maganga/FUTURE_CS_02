# Incident Response Simulation Report.

**Project:** Simulated system logs with event timestamps and Malware detection alerts.  
**Tools Used:** Splunk  
**Prepared by:** Duncan Maganga  
**Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Task:** 2  

## Executive Summary

This report documents the analysis of simulated system, network, and authentication logs collected from the organizationâ€™s SIEM platform. The objective was to detect suspicious activity, classify incidents by severity, and provide guidance on remediation.
During the investigation, five suspicious users were identified, including multiple log-in attempts and several malware signatures. Based on the impact, all the incidents were classified as high priority.	

## Purpose and Scope

**Purpose:** To simulate real-world incident detection and response using sample SIEM logs  
**Scope:** Analysis covered:  
- System logs with timestamps  
- Network connection logs with source and destination IPs  
- Authentication logs with successful and failed logging attempts  
- Malware detection alerts   


## Tools and Methodology

- **Tools:** Splunk 


## Methodology:
- Correlation and filtering: Applied different SPL queries  
- Classification: Incident ranked as High, Medium, or Low based on the impact.  
- Timeline Construction: Events mapped chronologically to understand the attack flow.  
- Mitigations: Drafted recommended containment and remediation actions.  

## Findings
Five users were flagged with the detection of malware
